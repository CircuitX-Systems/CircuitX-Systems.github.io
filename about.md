            Founded by a team of veteran embedded and cloud engineers, CircuitX Systems was created to bridge the gap between hardware and software. We noticed many innovative products failing due to poor integration. As a lean, agile startup, we are passionately focused on providing the foundational engineering critical for success in the competitive IoT landscape.
