        <p style="text-align:center; max-width: 800px; margin: -40px auto 0 auto;">Founded by a team of veteran embedded and cloud engineers, Keystone Systems was created to bridge the gap between hardware and software. We saw too many innovative products fail due to poor integration. As a startup, we are lean, agile, and passionately focused on providing the foundational engineering that we know is critical for success in the competitive IoT landscape.</p>
